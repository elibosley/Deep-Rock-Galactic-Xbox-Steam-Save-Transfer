# Deep Rock Galactic Save Transfer Tool

Use this tool to move your saves between Xbox Games Pass and Steam.

1. Rename .env.example to .env, and make sure you have the full path to both save files, including the file name (one in Xbox folder and one in steamapps folder)
2. Run the tool. If your save file in the Xbox folder changes names, it will automatically find the new file name based on the only file in the folder that doesn't include special characters.
3. Change dry-run to false to actually perform file updates. Otherwise it just tells you what it would do.
4. Enjoy, and if this helps you give it a star
